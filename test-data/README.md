# FlowScope Test Data Loading Instructions

This folder contains comprehensive test data for FlowScope that simulates real-world usage scenarios. Use these files to populate your FlowScope instance with realistic data for testing.

## üìÅ Test Data Files

### Core Data Files
- **`sample-traces.json`** - 10 realistic AI trace examples including successful calls, errors, and complex chains
- **`sample-users.json`** - 3 test users with different roles (admin, member, viewer)  
- **`sample-teams.json`** - 2 teams with different configurations and member structures
- **`sample-projects.json`** - 3 projects representing different AI use cases
- **`sample-comments.json`** - Collaborative comments and annotations on traces
- **`sample-shares.json`** - Share links demonstrating public and private sharing scenarios

### Test Scripts
- **`langchain-test.py`** - Python script demonstrating LangChain integration for VS Code extension testing

## üöÄ How to Load Test Data

### Method 1: Backend API (Recommended)
Your FlowScope backend is running at `http://localhost:3001` with these available endpoints:

**For Windows PowerShell users:**
```powershell
# First, verify the backend is healthy
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3001/api/health" -Method GET

# Load traces in batch (recommended approach)
cd "c:\Users\charlesidu\Downloads\FlowScope\test-data"
$body = Get-Content "sample-traces-batch-clean.json" -Raw
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3001/api/traces/batch" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"

# Load individual trace example
$singleTrace = @'
{
  "id": "custom-trace-1",
  "sessionId": "custom-session",
  "name": "Custom Test Trace",
  "type": "prompt",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-27T21:10:00Z",
  "data": {
    "input": "Your test input here"
  },
  "status": "completed"
}
'@
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3001/api/traces" -Method POST -Body $singleTrace -ContentType "application/json"
```

**For Unix/Linux/Mac (bash/zsh):**
```bash
# First, verify the backend is healthy
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/health

# Load multiple traces at once using batch endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/traces/batch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @sample-traces-batch-clean.json
```

**Note:** The backend doesn't currently have dedicated seeding endpoints, so you'll need to send traces individually or in batches using the traces API.

### Method 2: Direct Database Import
If using SQLite database directly:

```bash
# Copy JSON data to appropriate database tables
# (Requires custom script or manual database operations)
```

### Method 3: Manual UI Testing
For manual testing without backend integration:
1. Copy the JSON content from any file
2. Use browser developer tools to inject data into the application state
3. Refresh the FlowScope web interface

## üîÑ Updating Test Data

When modifying test data:

1. **Maintain Relationships:** Ensure IDs remain consistent across files
2. **Update Timestamps:** Use realistic, recent timestamps
3. **Validate JSON:** Check that all JSON files are syntactically correct
4. **Test Integration:** Verify changes work with actual FlowScope instance
5. **Document Changes:** Update this README with any new scenarios

## üêõ Troubleshooting Test Data

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Traces don't appear in UI
- Check that trace IDs are unique
- Verify project and user IDs exist in respective files
- Ensure timestamp format is correct (ISO 8601)

**Issue:** Comments don't display
- Verify `traceId` and `userId` references are valid
- Check that referenced users exist in `sample-users.json`
- Ensure comment content is properly escaped

**Issue:** Share links don't work
- Verify `shareToken` is unique and URL-safe
- Check that referenced `projectId` exists
- Ensure `traceIds` array references valid traces

**Issue:** Team permissions not working
- Verify user roles are one of: `admin`, `member`, `viewer`
- Check team membership arrays include all referenced users
- Ensure project ownership is assigned to valid users

### Data Consistency Checks

Run these checks before loading data:

```bash
# Check for duplicate IDs
grep -o '"id": "[^"]*"' *.json | sort | uniq -d

# Verify user references
grep -o '"userId": "[^"]*"' *.json | sort | uniq

# Check trace relationships  
grep -o '"parentId": "[^"]*"' sample-traces.json
```
