# 🔐 FlowScope Security Documentation

## ✅ Security Status: SECURE

The FlowScope repository has been audited and secured against credential exposure.

### 🛡️ Security Measures Implemented

#### **1. Environment Variable Protection**
- ✅ All sensitive credentials moved to `.env` file
- ✅ `.env` file properly ignored by git (`.gitignore`)
- ✅ Only example files with placeholders are tracked

#### **2. Database Connection Security**
- ✅ `deploy-schema.js` now uses environment variables
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in any tracked files
- ✅ Added dotenv dependency for secure variable loading

#### **3. Git History Cleanup**
- ✅ Sensitive data removed from git history
- ✅ Force pushed cleaned history to GitHub
- ✅ Previous commits with exposed credentials overwritten

### 📁 File Security Status

| File | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `packages/backend/.env` | ✅ **SECURE** | Git-ignored, contains actual credentials |
| `packages/backend/.env.example` | ✅ **SAFE** | Public template with placeholders only |
| `packages/backend/deploy-schema.js` | ✅ **SECURE** | Uses environment variables |
| All other files | ✅ **SAFE** | No sensitive data exposed |

### 🔍 Verified Protection

**Supabase Credentials**: ✅ Protected
- Database URL: In `.env` only
- Connection string: Environment variable
- API keys: Secure and git-ignored

**GitHub Repository**: ✅ Clean
- No exposed passwords in history
- No database credentials in public files
- All sensitive data properly protected

### ⚡ Quick Security Check

To verify security locally:

```bash
# Check that .env is ignored
git check-ignore packages/backend/.env
# Should output: packages/backend/.env

# Check no .env files are tracked
git ls-files | findstr ".env"
# Should only show .env.example files

# Verify deploy script uses environment variables
grep -n "process.env" packages/backend/deploy-schema.js
# Should show environment variable usage
```

### 🚀 Safe Usage

**For Development:**
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Fill in your actual credentials in `.env`
3. Never commit the `.env` file

**For Deployment:**
1. Set environment variables on your server
2. Use the same variable names as in `.env.example`
3. Run deployment scripts safely
