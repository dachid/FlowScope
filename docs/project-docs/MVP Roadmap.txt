# 🚩 **FlowScope MVP Roadmap**

This roadmap assumes an MVP delivered within approximately **12 weeks**.

---

## 📌 **Phase 1: Initialization & Setup (Weeks 1–2)**

**Goal:**
Set up foundational infrastructure, tools, and project scaffolding.

### 🔧 **Tasks:**

* **Infrastructure Setup**

  * Initialize code repository (GitHub/GitLab)
  * Configure CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
  * Set up cloud environment (AWS, Supabase)
  * Choose and configure project management tools (Jira, Notion)

* **Frontend Boilerplate**

  * Initialize React/TypeScript frontend (Vite or Next.js)
  * Configure Tailwind CSS/Shadcn UI components
  * Set up routing and state management

* **Backend/API Boilerplate**

  * Initialize NestJS backend with basic CRUD operations
  * Database schema setup (PostgreSQL via Supabase)
  * Setup Redis caching layer (optional)

### 🎯 **Outcomes:**

* Functional code repository
* Initial architecture in place
* Dev environments ready for rapid iteration

---

## 📌 **Phase 2: SDK & Framework Integrations (Weeks 3–5)**

**Goal:**
Establish foundational SDK to support at least two LLM frameworks (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex).

### 🔧 **Tasks:**

* **Cross-Framework SDK Design**

  * Define SDK interface and functions clearly
  * Build adapter pattern for framework integrations

* **Framework Integration**

  * Implement LangChain integration
  * Implement LlamaIndex integration
  * Test integrations thoroughly (unit tests, mock scenarios)

* **Logging and Telemetry**

  * SDK-side telemetry logging mechanism
  * Capture prompt metadata, inputs/outputs, execution traces

### 🎯 **Outcomes:**

* SDK alpha release with at least 2 integrations
* Basic logging and telemetry collection functional

---

## 📌 **Phase 3: Debugger Core & Prompt Versioning (Weeks 6–8)**

**Goal:**
Deliver core debugger functionalities: tracing, visualizations, and prompt versioning.

### 🔧 **Tasks:**

* **Visual Debugger UI**

  * Build initial debugger UI (chain visualization, prompt outputs)
  * Real-time visualization of chain executions and branches

* **Prompt Versioning System**

  * Git-like versioning (diff, branch, rollback)
  * Database structure to store prompt history

* **Real-time Trace Backend**

  * Streamline backend APIs to support real-time frontend visualizations

### 🎯 **Outcomes:**

* Functional debugger interface
* Prompt versioning and history tracking
* Real-time tracing of LLM executions

---

## 📌 **Phase 4: Plugin Development (Weeks 9–10)**

**Goal:**
Extend FlowScope's functionality via VS Code and browser extensions.

### 🔧 **Tasks:**

* **VS Code Plugin**

  * VS Code extension initialization (TypeScript)
  * Integration with backend APIs
  * Basic in-editor debugging and prompt previewing functionality

* **Browser Extension**

  * Chrome/Firefox browser extension initialization
  * Basic SDK integration for web-based LLM playgrounds
  * Prompt debugging and telemetry collection from browser contexts

### 🎯 **Outcomes:**

* VS Code and browser extensions functional
* Improved developer experience within common developer environments

---

## 📌 **Phase 5: Team Collaboration & SaaS Dashboard (Weeks 11–12)**

**Goal:**
Enable team collaboration and SaaS-based delivery for wider user adoption.

### 🔧 **Tasks:**

* **Team Collaboration Features**

  * Shareable debugging sessions (unique URLs)
  * Commenting and tagging in the debugging UI
  * Basic user authentication and permissions

* **Cloud SaaS Dashboard**

  * Deploy React frontend to cloud (AWS Amplify, Vercel)
  * Backend deployment (AWS ECS/Fargate, Supabase)
  * Setup user authentication and user/team management (Supabase Auth)

* **Testing & Stabilization**

  * Internal testing and bug fixing
  * Performance optimization of dashboard and backend services

### 🎯 **Outcomes:**

* SaaS-based MVP deployed and accessible publicly
* Collaboration features implemented
* MVP stable and ready for early adopter feedback

---

## 🎖️ **Phase 6: Launch & Feedback Collection (End of Week 12)**

**Goal:**
Official MVP launch to collect feedback from initial users.

### 🔧 **Tasks:**

* **Public Launch**

  * Launch MVP on Product Hunt, Hacker News, relevant forums, and developer communities
  * Social media announcement (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Reddit)

* **Collecting User Feedback**

  * Set up analytics tools for user behavior tracking (Mixpanel, Google Analytics)
  * Implement simple feedback forms and support channels

* **Early Support & Engagement**

  * Monitor and respond to early adopters
  * Prepare to iterate based on user feedback for next releases

### 🎯 **Outcomes:**

* Public MVP release successfully delivered
* Initial feedback collected and documented
* Early traction and visibility gained within developer communities
