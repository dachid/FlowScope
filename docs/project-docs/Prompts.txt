Great. Now let us begin phase 1 of the implementation plan. Keep the root folder as clean as possible, limit dependencies per package as they may be deployed separately in production.
Ensure there are tests written (proper testing freamework) to test every functionality in the system.
About naming conventions, do not use phased based nomenclature like (phase1,2 etc) when naming and building files and folders.

Proceed to implement phase 1
